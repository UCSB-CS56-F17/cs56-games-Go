a. This project is about a game called "Go", which could be played by two players.
b. As a player, I can click the square boxes inside the game window so that the clicked one could change colors indicating that I finish the step and get points. As a player, I can click the Directions button on the right so that I could learn how to play the game. As a player, I can click the restart button so that I could restart the game. As a player, I can click the "Skip Button" so that I can skip my turn of playing the game.
c.The software runs. We can click the tile boxes to make it change the color to black or white, which indicates the turn of the user. We can see that every time after the user finish its turn, the score will be updated on the right white areas and it will also indicate whose next turn should be. Also, we could click the buttons on the botton right like restart, skip turn, directions, surrender to get the functions accordingly.
d. As a user, every time I win, there should be a event like a congratulation sign indicating who wins. As a user, every time I restart the game, the score stores shoud be cleared. As a user, the Go chess shoud be a circular objects, black or white, that could be put on the top of the grid boxes, which is more like a real game.
e. README.md shoud be more specific about the game rules since lots of people do not know much about the game. Also, the screenshot of the game shoud be the game itselt without any other information. The file shoud also contain more pictures as pictures are easier for us to understand the game.
f. The build.xml file is up-to-date. The old legacy JWS and the targets are clear.
g. Yes, the issues could be added to 1000 points. Issues are clear and lots of changes should be made for either rewriting the code or adding new codes.
