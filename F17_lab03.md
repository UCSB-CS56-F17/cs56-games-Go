#Lab03 Questions

1. The project we are tasked with is to program the game of Go. It is an old Japanese game of strategy and territory. The game should allow two players to take turns laying 'stones' on a 19X19 grid, ultimately trying to own most of the board.

2. As a User, I can start a game, play the game, look at my score and take turns with my opponent.

3. The software runs and it allows the player to start the game and play.

4. The game could provide a box that tells the user of the current score and whos turn it is instead of a continuous stream of new text.

A gui that depicts a more realistic looking board and stones

Ability to switch between board themes and colors

Added feature of resizable window      

5. The current README repeats itself which seems to be due to bad pushing but it isn't really a problem, besides that the README gives a good general basic overview of the files and even some of the problems. I think to make the README better for future generations it needs to have a known error section to itself.

6.

7. I think there are definetely enough issues to earn 1000 points with this project, including the issue of restarting on Windows as well as pieces during the wrong color as the mouse goes over them. This along with improvements in a lacking GUI and messy code are all possible points. The issues in the repository are easy to understand.

8. I haven't been able to find many serious issues that haven't been addressed but one of the issues I see is the inability to choose which color as the game automatically picks the color depending on if you're player 1 or 2 and we do want te player to be able to rename the player name.
