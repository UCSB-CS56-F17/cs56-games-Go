#Lab03 Questions

1. The project we are tasked with is to program the game of Go. It is an old Japanese game of strategy and territory. The game should allow two players to take turns laying 'stones' on a 19X19 grid, ultimately trying to own most of the board.

2. As a User, I can start a game, play the game, look at my score and take turns with my opponent.

3. The software runs and it allows the player to start the game and play.

4. The game could provide a box that tells the user of the current score and whos turn it is instesd
